## Editing the website for CS+CPSC

To be added to this GitHub organization, just email Lindsay Clark or post an
issue with your request!  Students, alumni, and anyone affiliated with
CS+CPSC are welcome.

If you are a student and would like to use this website for showcasing your
accomplishments, please edit the
[Current Students](https://github.com/cs-cpsc-uiuc/cs-cpsc-uiuc.github.io/edit/master/currentstudents.md)
page to make a short profile for yourself with links to your projects, GitHub
profile, and professional networking sites.

Think this website could look nicer?  Know a few things about web design?
Go for it!  Just please leave the actual content pages in Markdown so that
they remain easy for everyone to edit.

Feel free to add links to resources and useful information for students.

If you are nervous about editing this site, you can always suggest changes using
a pull request rather than editing it directly.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cs-cpsc-uiuc/cs-cpsc-uiuc.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cs-cpsc-uiuc/cs-cpsc-uiuc.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
