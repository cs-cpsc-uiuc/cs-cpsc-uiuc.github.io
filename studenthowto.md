# How to set up your student portfolio on GitHub

See the [glossary of Git terms](gitglossary.md) for a quick reference if you are
new to Git.

Dataquest has a very useful
[blog post](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-share-data-science-portfolio/)
explaining how to set up a portfolio on GitHub, including an introduction to
how to use Git.

If you are working on a project that you might want to include in your
portfolio, it is advisable to create a repository for it in your GitHub account
from the beginning, so that a potential employer can look through your commit
history and see your process for creating code.  You can always make a
repository private and then decide later whether you want to make it public.

You are encouraged (but not required!) to add a short biography/resume to
the [Current Students](currentstudents.md) page.  You can clone
https://github.com/cs-cpsc-uiuc/cs-cpsc-uiuc.github.io to your hard drive
and make edits from there, or edit through the web browser at
https://github.com/cs-cpsc-uiuc/cs-cpsc-uiuc.github.io/blob/master/currentstudents.md.
You can upload a profile picture to the "portraits" folder of the website
repository.  Contact Lindsay Clark to get added to the organization so that you
have push access.

In your profile on the Current Students page, the following items are
recommended:
* Name
* Expected graduation date
* Link to your GitHub account
* Other links that you would want an employer to see, such as a LinkedIn profile
or personal website
* Links to two or three GitHub repositories that you worked on and would like to
showcase, with brief descriptions
* Your interests within the fields of computer science and agriculture
* Technical skills
* Internships or other relevant work experience

Keep it fairly brief, with a link to a longer resume if you wish.
